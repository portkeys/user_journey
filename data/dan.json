    "narrative": "# Your 2025 Outside Memory\n\n## Welcome, Dan\n\nWe're thrilled to celebrate your year with Outside Online and our community of outdoor enthusiasts. As one of our most engaged power users, you've logged nearly 5,200 interactions across our properties over the past five months\u2014a testament to your passion for the outdoors and the stories that fuel it. This is your personalized journey through 2025.\n\n---\n\n## Dan's 2025 Outside Memory\n\nYour engagement story this year tells the tale of a cyclist and mountain biker with an insatiable appetite for both the sport and the road. Your journey began in mid-July with a bang\u2014immediately diving into Tour de France coverage as the 2025 race unfolded. That first week, you were glued to VeloNews, consuming everything about Tadej Poga\u010dar's dominance, Jonas Vingegaard's strategic brilliance, and the drama unfolding on Mont Ventoux. You read pieces like *\"Poga\u010dar Plots to Bury Tour de France Rivals in the Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es\"* and *\"Your 2025 Tour de France Survival Guide if Tadej Poga\u010dar Keeps Winning,\"* establishing a pattern that would define your summer: following professional cycling with the intensity of a true fan.\n\nBut July also revealed another side of you. Alongside the pro racing obsession, you were actively exploring local trail networks\u2014Powder Ridge Mountain Park, Norbrook Farm Brewery and Trail Network, and Rockhouse Hill Sanctuary became your digital stomping grounds. You weren't just reading about mountain biking; you were planning rides, checking events, and engaging with the Trailforks community. This dual passion\u2014consuming elite professional cycling content while simultaneously planning your own dirt adventures\u2014emerged as your defining characteristic.\n\nAugust exploded with activity, accounting for nearly 36% of your total engagement for the period (1,874 events). This was your peak month, suggesting a summer when you were most connected to the community. You deepened your Trailforks engagement, exploring leaderboards on trails like Rollerville and Adeline Grey, studying ridelog data, and building your profile within the platform. Simultaneously, you remained locked into Tour de France coverage, following riders like Remco Evenepoel, Sepp Kuss, and Jo\u00e3o Almeida as the race progressed toward its conclusion.\n\nBy September through December, your engagement patterns shifted into a more measured rhythm\u2014still deeply invested, but reflecting the seasonal transition away from the summer cycling calendar. You maintained consistent interest in ski content (evidenced by your exploration of Banff Sunshine and Lake Louise), suggesting you were already planning your winter adventures. Your interest in mountain weather, snow reports, and family skiing destinations indicated you were transitioning your outdoor focus from two wheels to two planks, while never fully abandoning your cycling passion. Throughout this period, your afternoon engagement (particularly 1\u20133 PM) remained your prime time for consuming content, a habit that stayed consistent from summer through winter.\n\n---\n\n## Your Passions\n\n\u2022 **Professional Road Cycling** \u2014 You're a dedicated Tour de France enthusiast with 40 interactions tagged with the race itself. Your fascination with individual riders\u2014especially Tadej Poga\u010dar (20 tags), Jonas Vingegaard (19 tags), and Remco Evenepoel (14 tags)\u2014shows you follow storylines, not just results. You tracked team dynamics across UAE Team Emirates, Visma-Lease a Bike, and Team Uno-X with the focus of someone who understands the sport deeply.\n\n\u2022 **Mountain Biking & Trail Exploration** \u2014 Trailforks dominates your engagement (2,070 total interactions across the platform and app), making it your second home online. You're not a casual browser\u2014you check leaderboards, log rides, study trail reports, and actively explore regional networks around your area. Your engagement with Rollerville, Adeline Grey, and Lemon Squeezer trails shows you're invested in local terrain and community competition.\n\n\u2022 **Data-Driven Performance Tracking** \u2014 Your consistent interaction with ridelog features, activity feeds, leaderboards, and profile management suggests you're someone who values metrics and progress. You're tracking your own performance while staying connected to what others in your community are doing\u2014the hallmark of a competitive but community-minded athlete.\n\n\u2022 **Winter Sports & Ski Tourism** \u2014 As summer faded, your interest shifted toward ski destinations. Your exploration of Banff Sunshine, Lake Louise, and Colorado ski content, combined with searches for \"family skiing\" and \"best value\" ski resorts, indicates you're planning winter adventures and thinking about the broader ski experience beyond just the runs.\n\n\u2022 **Cycling News & Industry Coverage** \u2014 Beyond the race itself, you consume cycling journalism voraciously. Your engagement with VeloNews (203 interactions) and authors like Andrew Hood shows you want context, analysis, and storytelling around the sport\u2014not just results.\n\n\u2022 **Outdoor Adventure & Gear** \u2014 Your interaction with Outside Online's outdoor gear and adventure sections (6 gear-focused interactions, plus regular home feed browsing) shows you're interested in the full outdoor lifestyle\u2014the equipment, the destinations, and the experiences that make adventures possible.\n\n---\n\n## Reading Habits\n\nYour reading patterns reveal someone with a structured daily routine and clear peak engagement windows. You're most active between **1\u20132 PM** (1,094 events at hour 13), with secondary peaks at 2 PM and 4 PM. This suggests you're consuming content during work breaks or lunch hours, checking in on race updates and trail conditions throughout your day. Your evening engagement (8\u20139 PM) also remains strong, indicating you wind down by catching up on the day's cycling news or planning your next ride.\n\n**Tuesday is your power day**\u2014you logged 1,251 interactions on Tuesdays, nearly double your Saturday engagement. Mondays and Thursdays also rank high (979 and 947 events respectively), suggesting you're most engaged mid-week. Weekends show a dramatic drop, particularly Saturday (156 events), which is interesting given that weekends are typically when people ride. This pattern suggests you're using Outside's platforms for *planning* and *consuming* during the work week, then actually *doing* the activities on weekends.\n\nYour author engagement is distributed but focused\u2014you've encountered eight unique authors, with Andrew Hood appearing three times. While you're not following a single voice obsessively, your consistent return to VeloNews suggests you trust that publication's coverage of professional cycling. Your willingness to explore content across multiple platforms (Outside Online, VeloNews, Trailforks, Outside Watch, Yoga Journal) shows intellectual curiosity and a desire to see different perspectives on your passions. The data suggests you're a **purposeful reader**\u2014you know what you're looking for, you find it efficiently, and you move on to the next piece of information.",
