    "narrative": "# Your 2025 Outside Memory\n\n## Welcome Message\n\nDan, thank you for being such an engaged member of the Outside community! Over the past year, you've shown us what it means to be a true power user\u2014diving deep into our publications, exploring trails, and staying connected to the sports and adventures you love. We're thrilled to celebrate your journey with us.\n\n---\n\n## Dan's 2025 Outside Memory\n\nYour 2025 engagement tells the story of a passionate cyclist and mountain biker who lives and breathes the rhythm of the racing calendar and trail community. What stands out most is your laser focus: when the Tour de France captured global attention in mid-July, you were there tracking every development, from **Tadej Poga\u010dar's** dominant performances to the tactical battles unfolding in the **Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es**.\n\nYour engagement across our properties reveals a sophisticated, multi-platform approach to staying informed. You moved fluidly between **VeloNews** for breaking race coverage and analysis, **Outside Online** for broader lifestyle and gear content, and **Trailforks** for the hands-on mountain biking community experience. This wasn't passive consumption\u2014you were actively logging rides, managing your profile subscriptions, and engaging with the activity feed to stay connected with fellow riders.\n\nThe data shows you're particularly drawn to the high-stakes drama of professional cycling. Your reading patterns clustered around coverage of cycling's biggest stars: **Tadej Poga\u010dar**, **Joao Almeida**, **Jonas Vingegaard**, and **Remco Evenepoel**. You consumed pieces like *\"Poga\u010dar Plots to Bury Tour de France Rivals in the Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es\"* and *\"Your 2025 Tour de France Survival Guide if Tadej Poga\u010dar Keeps Winning\"*\u2014content that speaks to both the technical analysis and the narrative drama you crave.\n\nWhat's particularly telling is your evening engagement pattern. Between 6 PM and 9 PM, you dove deepest into content, suggesting these are your prime hours for catching up on the day's racing developments and planning your own adventures. You balanced this with midday activity\u2014checking trail maps, logging rides, and staying connected to your Trailforks community. You're not just reading about cycling; you're living it.\n\n---\n\n## Your Passions\n\n\u2022 **Professional Road Cycling** \u2014 Your engagement with Tour de France coverage, **UAE Emirates** team dynamics, and the rivalry between cycling's elite athletes dominates your reading. You're following the sport at the highest level with genuine expertise.\n\n\u2022 **Mountain Biking & Trail Culture** \u2014 Trailforks is your second home. You're actively logging rides, exploring trail databases, and engaging with the mountain biking community\u2014this isn't casual interest, it's a core part of your athletic identity.\n\n\u2022 **Cycling Analysis & Strategy** \u2014 You gravitate toward pieces that break down race tactics, rider performance, and competitive dynamics. You want to understand *why* things happen on the bike, not just *what* happened.\n\n\u2022 **Adventure & Outdoor Gear** \u2014 Your exploration of content like *\"Ready for Adventure\"* and *\"Return to Sender\"* shows you're interested in the equipment and vehicles that enable outdoor experiences, from bikes to adventure-ready vehicles.\n\n\u2022 **Community Engagement** \u2014 Your active use of Trailforks' activity feeds, profile management, and subscription controls reveals you value connection with fellow riders and staying updated on what your community is doing.\n\n\u2022 **Competitive Cycling Events** \u2014 Your visits to mountain biking events calendars and race coverage suggest you're not just a spectator\u2014you're interested in participating in and staying informed about organized cycling events.\n\n---\n\n## Reading Habits\n\nYour reading patterns reveal someone who treats content consumption strategically. You concentrate your engagement in two distinct windows: **midday (12-1 PM)** and **evening (6-9 PM)**. The afternoon surge suggests you're catching up during a work break or lunch hour, while your evening deep-dives\u2014particularly between 6-9 PM\u2014indicate this is when you settle in for serious engagement with analysis and race coverage. Over your tracked period, you generated 162 events across just two days, showing intense, focused bursts of activity rather than casual browsing.\n\nYou're a **multi-platform reader** who understands where to find different types of content. **VeloNews** captures your race-day engagement and breaking news, while **Outside Online** serves your broader lifestyle and gear interests. **Trailforks** is where you shift from consumer to participant\u2014it's not just reading; it's logging, rating, and connecting. This diversification across seven unique publications shows sophistication in how you navigate the media landscape.\n\nYour author engagement suggests you trust bylines and follow specific voices. While the sample shows work from **Andrew Hood**, **Hannah Gross**, and **Agence France-Presse**, your focus on *tagged* content\u2014particularly stories about specific riders and races\u2014indicates you're driven more by subject matter expertise than individual author loyalty. You're following the story, the athletes, and the competition first. This is the reading pattern of someone who knows exactly what they're looking for and moves decisively to find it.",
