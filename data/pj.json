    "narrative": "# Your 2025 Outside Memory\n\n## Welcome Message\n\nHello PJ! We're thrilled to celebrate your year with Outside\u2014you've been an incredible member of our community. With nearly 800 interactions across our platforms over the past year, you've shown us what true engagement looks like. Whether you're sharing your adventures, exploring new trails, or diving into our latest gear stories, you've made Outside Online a meaningful part of your life.\n\n---\n\n## PJ's 2025 Outside Memory\n\nYour year with Outside tells the story of an adventurer who moves fluidly between seasons, disciplines, and discovery. Starting in January with winter milestones like frozen Hudson River reflections and ski days at Teton Village and Berthoud Pass, you established yourself as someone who celebrates the small, poetic moments alongside the big outdoor experiences. By March, your engagement shifted into high gear\u2014you were not only consuming content but actively participating in the Outside community, sharing your own \"new bike day\" moments and diving deep into trail exploration through Trailforks.\n\nSpring brought a shift in your attention. While you continued to engage with skiing and biking content, you started exploring broader themes: you were drawn to stories about community (Engineering Days in Golden), environmental stewardship (Earth Day trail cleanups), and the wildlife encounters that pepper outdoor life (ducks, peacocks, grouse in trees). Your engagement dipped slightly through summer, but this appears to be a natural seasonal rhythm rather than waning interest. By October, you were back with renewed energy, exploring Outside Classics and deepening your connection to our adventure travel content.\n\nThe final quarter of 2025 was your most active period\u2014November and December saw a surge of engagement that tells a clear story: you were planning. You explored new ski hotels for the 2025-26 winter season, investigated luxury travel destinations, and dove into Trailforks' trail database with fresh curiosity. You even discovered Trailforks' daily games (Summit Locator and Guess The Trail), suggesting you're someone who enjoys the playful, interactive side of outdoor exploration. Your engagement pattern shows you're not just a passive reader\u2014you're an active planner, sharer, and community member who sees Outside as both inspiration and practical resource.\n\n---\n\n## Your Passions\n\n\u2022 **Winter Sports & Ski Culture** \u2014 From Teton Village to Berthoud Pass, your early-year activities show a deep commitment to skiing. Your engagement with ski resort content, new ski hotels, and winter travel planning demonstrates this is more than a seasonal hobby\u2014it's central to how you experience the year.\n\n\u2022 **Mountain Biking & Trail Exploration** \u2014 Your \"new bike day\" posts and extensive Trailforks activity (207 events) reveal a serious mountain biker. You're not just riding; you're exploring trails across regions\u2014from Loveland, Colorado to British Columbia's Femur Mountain and S&M trails\u2014and engaging with the trail database as both reference and inspiration.\n\n\u2022 **Adventure Travel & Destination Discovery** \u2014 Your curiosity spans continents. You've explored content tagged with Australia, British Columbia, Canada, and Florida. The manatees tag suggests you're drawn to unique wildlife experiences, while your interest in eco-ski hotels and luxury travel shows you think intentionally about how and where you explore.\n\n\u2022 **Community & Shared Experience** \u2014 Your activity feed reveals someone who celebrates others' adventures and shares your own. From commenting on trail cleanups to sharing your Engineering Days discovery, you're invested in the social fabric of the Outside community.\n\n\u2022 **Gear & Practical Preparation** \u2014 Your engagement with commerce tags, gift guides, and specific gear reviews (like the 39 insulated beverage containers tested in the Outside Lab) shows you approach outdoor pursuits thoughtfully, seeking quality equipment and informed recommendations.\n\n\u2022 **Wildlife & Natural Observation** \u2014 Throughout your year, you've engaged with stories celebrating unexpected wildlife encounters\u2014grouse in trees, ducks in alleys, peacocks in neighborhoods. You appreciate the small moments of wonder that outdoor life offers.\n\n---\n\n## Reading Habits\n\nYour reading patterns reveal someone with a distinctly evening and late-night rhythm. Your peak engagement hours are 9 PM (159 events) and 11 PM (90 events), with another surge around 5 PM (134 events) and 4 PM (71 events). This suggests you're using Outside content during wind-down hours and planning sessions\u2014perhaps researching trips after work or exploring trails and gear late at night. You're most active on Mondays (205 events) and Tuesdays (169 events), with strong engagement continuing through Thursday (163 events), indicating you use Outside as part of your weekday routine, likely planning weekend adventures or reflecting on recent ones.\n\nYour content consumption is highly seasonal and purpose-driven. January through March showed consistent engagement as you documented winter activities and transitioned into spring. A notable dip in May through August suggests you're more likely to be *doing* outdoor activities than reading about them during peak seasons\u2014a sign of a genuine, active adventurer. The dramatic surge beginning in November (235 events) and peaking in December (303 events) clearly correlates with winter planning season, when you're researching destinations, gear, and accommodations for the ski season ahead.\n\nWhat's particularly striking about your reading habits is your multi-platform loyalty. While Outside Online is your primary home (283 events), you're equally invested in Trailforks (207 events) and actively explore Backpacker, VeloNews, and ski-specific content. You don't just read articles\u2014you engage with maps, games, activity feeds, and your own profile, suggesting you see these platforms as tools for planning, tracking, and sharing your adventures, not just sources of inspiration.",
